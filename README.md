# go-time-tracker

a command line time tracker written in Go

## What's inside?

For a V1 I want to have this feature set completed:

- [ ] Documentation;
- [ ] Command Line based UI;
- [ ] Category-based time tracking;
- [ ] Track and comment time spans;
- [ ] Invoice (PDF) Exporter;
- [ ] TOML Config;
